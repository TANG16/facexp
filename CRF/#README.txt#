Conditional Random Fields for pairwise networks.
Code written by Kevin Murphy (murphyk@ai.mit.edu) 2004

Try 'testCRF'  to get started.

This requires netlab and my BPMRF2 (belief propagation for pairwise
MRFs) code. This is exact for chains but approximate for loopy graphs.

Two kinds of CRF structures are supported:

- crfchain for 1D chains

- crf for general graphs (including 2D lattices)

Note that netlab requires that certain function names start with lower
case, e.g., crferr not crfErr (since it uses feval and matlab 7
enforces strict case sensitivity).


The potentials are defined  as follows

For hidden edge e=i-j:
   psi{e}(qi,qj) is a table.

For local evidence
  phi{i}(qi) = exp[ sum_d w{i}(d,qi) f{i}(d) ]

where f{i}(:) is the feature vector for node i
and w{i}(:, :) is the weight matrix relating this feature vector to
the states qi.
